# CDK Guru
## What is this?
I started [CDK Guru](https://cdkguru.github.io/) as a site to evangelize the AWS CDK and serve as a hub for my learnings that I have gathered while using it.

## Local Development
### Installation
1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.
### Adding Posts
1. Run `jekyll serve` to start the server
1. Add new file to the `_posts` directory with the filename pattern `YYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md`
1. View your post!

## Credits
This Jekyll site is hosted in GitHub Pages and the Jekyll content was forked from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
